# SimPushbackXP Changelog

## [0.0.15-dev] - 2025-08-10
### Added
- **BetterPushback conflict detection**: If another planepath controller is active (e.g., BetterPushback), SimPushbackXP warns and refuses to start to avoid control fights.
- **Conflict status tool**: Menu item “Conflict status → log” prints whether BetterPushback is present and if the sim’s planepath override is already active.

### Changed
- Safer start logic: We only enable override when it’s not already owned by another plugin.

## [0.0.14-dev] - 2025-08-10
- Curved pushback path, ground-level tug placement, override planepath fix, XP12 default tug use.

## [0.0.13-dev] - 2025-08-10
### Added
- **Default X-Plane 12 tug model support** — no more bundled OBJ file; the plugin now uses built-in library tug objects such as:
  - `lib/airport/vehicles/pushback/tug.obj`
  - `lib/airport/vehicles/pushback/tug_lrg.obj`
  - `lib/airport/vehicles/ground_handling/tug.obj`
  - `lib/airport/vehicles/ground_handling/towtractor.obj`
- **Improved turning behavior** — aircraft now begins rotation earlier in the pushback for a smoother and more visible curve.
- **Parking brake auto-release** — brake is released when pushback starts to avoid drag or incomplete movement.
- **Detailed logging** — log file now records which library object was resolved and loaded, plus optional per-frame debug lines.
- **Compatibility fallback** — tries multiple object lookup signatures to work across different XPPython3 versions.

### Changed
- Removed dependency on `objects/tug_default.obj` to prevent the “IDX count is out of range” startup error.
- Slightly increased turn rate limits for tighter ground maneuvering.

### Fixed
- Startup crash when selecting a tug type with no corresponding model loaded.
- Pushback always moving straight back — now direction choices (90°, 180°, compass headings) are properly applied.


### Installation
1. Extract the zip.
2. Copy `PI_SimPushbackXP.py` into:
   ```
   X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/PythonPlugins/
   ```
3. Delete any old bundled tug objects from:
   ```
   X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/PythonPlugins/objects/tug_default.obj
   ```
4. Reload scripts in-sim: **Plugins → XPPython3 → Reload Scripts**, or restart X-Plane.
